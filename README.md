# awok_calculator

A new Simple calculator application.

## Getting Started

It is required to design and build a simple calculator application
with Dart and Flutter. The excellent features available in the Dart
language and Flutter SDK provide the modern developer with a
great toolkit for quickly trying new ideas and building high
performance applications.

This basic calculator app will combine a simple user interface, a
few standard operations and functions, and an output to display
the result, so it makes a great starter application or template for
another similar basic app design.

Code Requirements:
● Reuse of Code is Highly Required.
● Follow Clean Code Architecture,
● Use Built In Functions in Dart and Flutter.
● No Use of Third Party Library.
● UI should be designed for Phones and Tablets.
Outputs
1. Share Code Repo.
2. Code Explanations as much as you can.
3. Send APK file for android.
